# Automessage
A Visual Basic Script to automate sending messaages.

PLEASE NOTE:
This program will only work on windows/linux (With wine), In the future I am planning on supporting mac os but not right now.

Usage:
This program is really useful for games like Runescape or forums where you want to advertise for instance every 20 minutes.

Why This program?:
This program is really light weight (Only 13 lines of code!) and can run in the background with using little to no cpu power (On a i7 920 it only uses 3% of the cpu!)
